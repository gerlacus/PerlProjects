# Practice Perl Project Collection
Various little projects to familiarize myself with Perl. 
Though some may say Perl is a dying language, it's still a language that I've always wanted to learn.
Luckily, when I don't have any projects to work on, my boss is letting me learn more programming skills on my own. Woohoo!
I will grow this repository as I develop more Perl code, but for now it is in an unfortunate state of "not having any Perl code".

<h5>Pyramid Generator(2test.pl)</h5>
Simple program that takes input size / string from user and creates a pyramid of said string as tall as the size specified.
Whipped up in a few minutes, this was more or less a way to familiarize myself with the conventions of Perl (e.g. $calars and foreach loop syntax).
